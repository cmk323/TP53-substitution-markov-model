# TP53-substitution-markov-model
The TP53 gene encodes the tumor suppressor protein p53 which has been extensively studied for its role in cell death and human cancers. Base substitution mutations are one of the most common mutation types to occur in the human TP53 gene, with missense substitution mutations accounting for approximately 61% of all observed TP53 mutations. The aim of this investigation is to examine the extent to which the frequencies of base substitution mutations in TP53 gene sequence samples from tumors from various human tissues can be accurately modeled using Markov matrices.
